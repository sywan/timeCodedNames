    (1) This program copies the JPG/PNG/TIFF/BMP/GIF files in the specified source directory to a
        destination directory. If the source and destination are identical, a sub-directory "sorted" is
        forcefully created for the user.
    (2) The file names are replaced by their last updated date/time. [Obsolete: If two files were last
        updated at the same time, an incremental post-fix shall be automatically added.]
